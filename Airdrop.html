### Airdrop HTML File:

The **airdrop.html** remains the same and doesnâ€™t need to include a license.

### Next Steps

You can leave the contract unlicensed, or you can:
- **Choose a different license** (such as GPL, Apache, or a proprietary license).
- If no license is used, be aware that others might have fewer restrictions on reusing or modifying the contract.
  
If you'd like more information on specific licenses or other guidance, feel free to ask!
